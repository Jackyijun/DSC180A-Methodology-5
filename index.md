1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting topic covered is the Greedy Path Following Quantization(GPFQ) algorithm that perform model quantization without losing much accuracy and yet was able to compress parameters from 32 bits down to merely 4 bits
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
Quantize pre-trained/trained models with subset of data that we are interested in, instead of the entire training set. And investigate in specific layers for quantization, is it better to heavily quantize first initial layers or deeper layers.
3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
May be orchestrate more time to sit down with my teammates to do pair programming, currently we are too busy to organize and thus majority of work is done seperately by assigning different task to ourselves and communicate on social media
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
Some techniques in math's optimization algorithm might help for our quantization
